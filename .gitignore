This way of representing things is called base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system.\n The flag for this challenge is a 10-digit number in the decimal number system(ranges from 0 to 9).\n We have given your computer special instructions to hide it away from you. \nBut you know how computers are,they are high maintenance.So maybe if you ask it nicely,\n it might tell you what the flag is!<button>Ask computer nicely</button><br>  <input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"answer\"></input> If user enters answer in binary, story continues:  Well, the flag that you have entered might be correct \nbut there's no way of verifying it. We, unlike computers, only speak decimal. So can you please present the flag in a way that we understand? </p>"
